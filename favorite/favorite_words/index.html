<p>People hate change&hellip;</p>

<p>Because people hate change&hellip;</p>

<p>I want you to understand me well.</p>

<hr />

<p>You should think carefully that the more introduce a new system in the forefront, it is difficult to handle, doubtful of success, and dangeraus to manage.</p>

<p>For those who wil introduce, those who benefit from the old system are all enemies, and those who benefit from the new system can recive only half-hearted support.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>君主論(1513)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Now of Japanese society feel like there isn&rsquo;t much to think is in a position of the other paty.</p>

<p>I think that the tendency to eliminate disturbing things for myself is increasing.</p>

<p>That tendency also appears in children, and it seems that it is a problem sach as bullying.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nobady will rate with Being when going to sciety.</p>

<p>Doing is an evaluation of behavior, Having is an evaluation of person&rsquo;s possiton, what he has, and so on.</p>

<p>Being is an evaluation of existence.</p>

<hr />

<p>There is no man to tell a lie to this world.</p>

<p>In order words, there are no human beings who have never been lied.</p>

<p>As long as you live you are deceived or ceiced.</p>

<p>See the trath yourself!</p>

<hr />

<p>&ldquo;A good person&rdquo; believes in the common sense of the unconditionally and thinks that it fits in the frame set by the public.</p>

<p>It has no power to think on my own head.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have the courage to jude and act on my own.</p>

<p>Therefore, I can&rsquo;t trust.</p>

<hr />

<p>Thanks to them, you can learn valuable teaching in life, meet the people you need, and acquire the wisdom and skills to overcome the problem.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you want to change the dirty structure, be bound by the sense of justice, don&rsquo;t make the morement inconvenient.</p>

<p>Take in all good and evil, move supple!</p>

<p>You can hit the real evil one day with the power you have accumulated.</p>

<p>For most of what happens in this world, invisible things start with a trigger and end.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled whon I create my own image.</p>

<p>And those who feel motivated to move oneself and make real shapes.</p>

<p>Also, people who feel joyful in connecting people and people, communicaing various information and supporting them.</p>
